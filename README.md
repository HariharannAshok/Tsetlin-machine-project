# Tsetlin-machine-project(Sentiment Analysis)
This project explores the use of Tsetlin Machines for sentiment analysis and machine translation, specifically focusing on UK slang. The goal was to develop a robust natural language processing (NLP) system capable of accurately translating British slang into standard English while preserving the original sentiment.

Key Features:

Slang Normalization: Developed a custom slang dictionary to convert informal language into standard English.
Sentiment Analysis: Implemented a Tsetlin Machine model for classifying sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) in slang-infused text.
Model Performance: Achieved competitive accuracy, precision, and recall metrics, outperforming traditional deep learning models like CNNs and RNNs in certain aspects, particularly in interpretability and efficiency.
Technologies Used:

Python
Tsetlin Machines
NLP techniques
Custom slang dictionary
Data preprocessing (tokenization, one-hot encoding, etc.)
Applications: This project has potential applications in real-time social media monitoring, customer sentiment tracking, and any domain where understanding informal language is crucial.
