# Tsetlin-machine-project
This project explores the use of Tsetlin Machines for sentiment analysis and machine translation, specifically focusing on UK slang. The goal was to develop a robust natural language processing (NLP) system capable of accurately translating British slang into standard English while preserving the original sentiment.
